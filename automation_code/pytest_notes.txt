Arrange
Arrange is where we prepare everything for our test.
============
Act
Act is the singular, state-changing action that kicks off the behavior we want to test.
================
Assert
Assert is where we look at that resulting state and check if it looks how we’d expect after the dust has settled.
=================
Cleanup
Cleanup is where the test picks up after itself, so other tests aren’t being accidentally influenced by it.
=====================
