========================
Arrange
Arrange is where we prepare everything for our test.

Act
Act is the singular, state-changing action that kicks off the behavior we want to test.

Assert
Assert is where we look at that resulting state and check if it looks how we’d expect after the dust has settled.

Cleanup
Cleanup is where the test picks up after itself, so other tests aren’t being accidentally influenced by it.
